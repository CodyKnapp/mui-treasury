`Layout` is the entry point to build your layout. If you use ES6 with npm, you can write `import Layout from '@mui-treasury/layout'`.

---

## Overview

`Layout` from @mui-treasury/layout is a function that return LayoutBuilder interface.

**_Interface_**

```typescript
type Layout = (config?: LayoutConfig) => ILayoutBuilder;
```

`Layout` can accept initial config, this is useful when you want to use config file like JSON for different environments.
It is recommended to use configuration API below and then call `scheme.getJSON` to generate JSON file.

**_Usage Example_**

```js
import Layout from '@mui-treasury/layout'

const scheme = Layout()
```

`scheme` is a layout builder that can configure different part of layout such as `Header`, `EdgeSidebar`, `InsetSidebar` and many more.

## Layout builder API

- [scheme.configureHeader](/layout/api-reference/header-builder) : function that provide `Header` builder to a received callback.
---
- [scheme.configureEdgeSidebar](/layout/api-reference/edge-sidebar-builder) : function that provide `EdgeSidebar` builder to a received callback.
---
- [scheme.configureInsetSidebar](/layout/api-reference/inset-sidebar-builder) : function that provide `InsetSidebar` builder to a received callback.
---
- [scheme.enableAutoCollapse](#enableautocollapse) : enable auto collapse at a breakpoint for specific sidebar.
---
- [scheme.clone](#clone) : get a snapshot of layout config at the time it is called.
---
- [scheme.getJSON](#getjson) : `console.log` a JSON object for setting up layout from [config file]()
---
- [scheme.debug](#debug) : debug current layout config, log to console as table.
---

For `Content` and `Footer`, there is no need to configure because it is auto generated and there is no promising feature for them at this point. So to make it simple,
you can just import the components and that's it.

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { getLayoutComponents } from '@mui-treasury/layout';

const { Root, Content, Footer } = getLayoutComponents(styled)

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Root scheme={yourScheme}>
      <Content>...</Content>
      <Footer>...</Footer>
    </Root>
  )
}
```
