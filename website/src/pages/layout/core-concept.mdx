There are 3 parts that synchronize with each other. configuration, logic and components.

### Data flow

In order to build layout, you need to use layout api to setup configuration of your layout.
Think of it as a set of commands to control the behavior and effect of the components. Technically, config is just
a plain object of key-value pairs. let see some example.

```js
import Layout from '@mui-treasury/layout';

const scheme = Layout();
// scheme is layout builder
// you can config each part of layout
scheme.configureHeader(builder => {
  // set up Header
});

// usually in dashboard layout, you need this sidebar
scheme.configureEdgeSidebar(builder => {
  // set up EdgeSidebar
});

// usually in blog, doc layout, you need this sidebar
schme.configureInsetSidebar(builder => {
  // set up InsetSidebar
});
```

we will not go into detail at this point because we want you to get to know how it works. After config is set, the `scheme`
must be sent to `Root` component to let it spread the commands. `Root` is react context provider behind the scene (no magic here)
The config that `Root` receive will be encapsulated for communicating with other components.

```js
// highlight-start
import Layout, { Root } from '@mui-treasury/layout';
// highlight-end
const scheme = Layout();
// ----
// setup phase
// ----

// highlight-start
const App = () => {
  return <Root scheme={scheme}></Root>;
};
// highlight-end
```

Finally, place components inside `Root` to let them get the commands and display based on each responsibility of each component.
ex. `EdgeSidebar` will stay on the edge of the browser, left or right depends on the configuration. On the other hand, `InsetSidebar` is designed to
display inside of the container.

However, before you import components from the library you need to specify css-in-js library first.
In this example, we are using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)

```js
// highlight-start
import Layout, {
  Root,
  getHeader,
  getEdgeSidebar,
  getContent,
  getFooter,
} from '@mui-treasury/layout';
import styled from 'styled-components';
// highlight-end
// @emotion/styled is also compatible
const scheme = Layout();
// ----
// setup phase
// ----

// get component 1 by 1 to minimize bundle size
const Header = getHeader(styled)
const EdgeSidebar = getEdgeSidebar(styled)
const Content = getContent(styled)
const Footer = getFooter(styled)

// highlight-start
const App = () => {
  return (
    <Root scheme={scheme}>
      <Header />
      <EdgeSidebar />
      <Content />
      <Footer />
    </Root>
  );
};
// highlight-end
```

  }}
